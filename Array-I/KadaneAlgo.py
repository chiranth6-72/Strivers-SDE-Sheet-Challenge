# ***  Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array
# Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which
# has the largest sum and returns its sum and prints the subarray.

# The intuition of the algorithm is not to consider the subarray as a part of the answer if its sum is less than 0. A subarray with a sum less than 0 will always reduce our answer and so this type of subarray cannot be a part of the subarray with maximum sum.

        if curSum == 0:
            start = i
        curSum += nums[i]

        maxim = max(maxim, curSum)
        end = i

        if curSum < 0:
            curSum = 0
